# Pathfinder
Fully functional path-finding algorithm using a Breadth First Search

Our code was written in Java in the eclipse IDE. Our project can be imported into eclipse and run from there or a jar file can be made and run. Our output is in three stages: the first is the blank map after being scanned in, the second is the map with the path taken by the first robot, and the third output is the map with the paths of both robots. The path of the first robot is marked by .s; the path of the second robot is marked by *s; and where the paths overlap, the mark of the second robot is shown. The user is prompted for the location of the map at the beginning of the program.
